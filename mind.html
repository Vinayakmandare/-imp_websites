<article id="article" >Akinator is a web-based game and mobile app that uses artificial intelligence to guess the character you are thinking of by asking a series of questions. The game was created in 2007 by French programmers and has become popular worldwide. To play, you simply think of a character, real or fictional, and Akinator will start asking you questions about the character. The questions are usually simple yes or no questions, such as "Is your character male?" or "Is your character from a video game?" based on your answers, Akinator will narrow down the possibilities and eventually make a guess as to who your character is. The game is designed to be challenging, and Akinator can often guess the correct answer even for obscure characters.</article>
