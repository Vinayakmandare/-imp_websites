<article>Krisp.ai is an artificial intelligence-powered noise-cancellation app that mutes background noise during voice and video calls. It uses a machine learning algorithm to filter out unwanted sounds such as barking dogs, keyboard typing, or street noise, leaving only clear voice communication. The app can be used with any communication app, including Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Skype, and more, and is available on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. Krisp.ai offers a free trial for its service, and users can choose to subscribe to a monthly or yearly plan for continued use.</article>
