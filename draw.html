<article id="article">AutoDraw is an artificial intelligence experiment created by Google that allows you to draw simple sketches or doodles and then uses machine learning to suggest a more polished image based on what you have drawn. The tool is designed to help people who are not skilled at drawing to create professional-looking images quickly and easily.

AutoDraw works by analyzing the lines and shapes in your drawing and then comparing them to a database of thousands of images created by professional artists. It then suggests a list of possible matches that you can choose from to replace your rough sketch with a more refined image.

The tool is free to use and can be accessed through any web browser. It can be used for a variety of purposes, such as creating logos, illustrations, and simple graphics for presentations or social media posts.</article>
