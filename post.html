<article id="article">PostSecret is an ongoing community art project where people mail in their secrets anonymously on a postcard. It was started in 2005 by artist Frank Warren, who would distribute postcards to strangers and ask them to write down a secret they had never told anyone before. The project has since grown to become a popular online platform, where people from around the world can submit their secrets through the PostSecret website or mobile app.

Each week, a selection of secrets is chosen by Warren and shared on the PostSecret website, social media accounts, and in books. The secrets range from funny and lighthearted to serious and emotional, covering a wide range of topics such as love, loss, guilt, and regrets.

PostSecret has become a cultural phenomenon, inspiring books, art exhibits, and a TED talk. It provides a space for people to anonymously share their secrets, feel heard, and connect with others who may be going through similar experiences. The project also raises awareness about the importance of mental health and the power of vulnerability and honesty in breaking down social barriers.</article>
