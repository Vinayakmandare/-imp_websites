<article id="article">VirusTotal is a free online service that allows users to scan files and URLs for viruses, malware, and other types of malicious content using over 70 antivirus engines and other security tools. It was founded in 2004 and was acquired by Google in 2012.

To use VirusTotal, a user can simply upload a file or enter a URL into the website's search bar, and the service will scan the file or website for any signs of malicious content. The results of the scan are then displayed, showing which antivirus engines detected potential threats and which did not.

VirusTotal is a valuable tool for individuals and organizations who want to quickly and easily check the safety of files and websites. It can be particularly useful for security professionals who need to quickly analyze suspicious files or URLs and determine whether they pose a threat.</article>
