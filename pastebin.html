<article>Pastebin is a popular online platform that allows users to store and share text-based information, such as source code, configuration files, or messages. Users can create a new "paste" by entering their text in the designated field and setting various options, such as expiration time, syntax highlighting, or access control.

Once a paste is created, users receive a unique URL that they can share with others, either publicly or privately. Pastebin also provides various features such as password protection, burn-after-reading, or raw paste data access.

Pastebin is used by programmers, hackers, journalists, and other users who need to share text-based information securely and efficiently. It is particularly useful for sharing code snippets, debugging information, and other technical content. However, due to its anonymity and lack of moderation, Pastebin has also been used for malicious purposes, such as sharing stolen data, malware code, or hacking tools. As a result, Pastebin has implemented various measures to detect and remove illegal content, such as automated filters, human moderators, and collaboration with law enforcement agencies.</article>
